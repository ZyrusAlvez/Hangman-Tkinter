In our game, the developers themselves are the characters with unique abilities to help players succeed. It's a fun twist where the creators join the action, making the game truly one-of-a-kind.

**Contents:**
* Image animation
* Key binds
* Custom graphics and graphical elements
* Sounds
* Comedic names and descriptions
* Point system
* Skill system
* Leaderboards using sqlite3

**Downside:**
* I was still practicing folder structure and OOP based blueprint so the object's attributes and methods are not in their best form
* Tkinter is not actually good when it comes to image rendering and ms configuration thus building a game using this library is really slow
* The animation performance highly differs on the users/players device.
